			<strong>Health is wealth</strong> is a common proverb which reveals a very simple meaning by comparing the value of health with the wealth. It is said in this proverb that health of a man is as much important as the wealth to live a <em>healthy, peaceful and prosperous life</em>. Everyone knows that nothing is important in life than the good health. No one can be happy and peaceful without a good health. There is no success in people’s life if they suffer with bad health. Unhealthy people carry various diseases so they cannot enjoy the real pleasure of being a rich people.
